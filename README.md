<h3>Dataset</h3><br/>
We use the dataset from https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3193805/wiki/89480. Specifically, we use the Raw Data from the Abdomen folder

<h3>Description on code</h3>
We used a Jupyter Notebook to train the four models, UNet, TransUNET, UNETR, SwinUNETR. UNet was trained locally, while TransUNET, UNETR, SwinUNETR was trained on Google Colab. The specificiations of the GPU used are on the Final Project report.
